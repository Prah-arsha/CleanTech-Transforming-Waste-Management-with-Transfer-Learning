HematoVision aims to develop an accurate and efficient model for classifying blood cells by employing transfer learning techniques.
♻️ CleanTech: Transforming Waste Management with Transfer Learning
🧠 Project Summary
CleanTech is an AI-powered solution that applies Transfer Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify waste materials into categories such as biodegradable and non-biodegradable. The goal is to revolutionize traditional waste management systems by enabling smart and automated waste classification, which can be used by municipalities, recycling centers, educational platforms, and mobile waste collection units.

The system uses a pre-trained deep learning model (like MobileNetV2), fine-tuned with a custom dataset of waste images. This approach ensures high classification accuracy with low computational cost. The trained model is capable of identifying waste types from images with minimal human intervention, paving the way for AI-assisted sustainability practices.

🎯 Project Objectives
To automate the classification of waste using Transfer Learning techniques

To reduce manual effort and error in waste segregation

To provide a scalable model that can be integrated into smart bins, mobile apps, or web platforms

To raise awareness of AI applications in environmental conservation and sustainability

🛠️ Technologies Used
Language: Python 3.8+

Libraries/Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, OpenCV

Model: MobileNetV2 (pre-trained CNN via Transfer Learning)

IDE: Visual Studio Code / Jupyter Notebook

Deployment-ready: Model saved as .h5 file, ready for Flask or Streamlit UI integration

🧪 How It Works
The model is initialized using MobileNetV2 without the top classification layers.

Custom classification layers are added on top to distinguish between waste classes.

The dataset is loaded and split into training and testing sets.

The model is trained and fine-tuned on these waste images.

Once trained, the model is saved in .h5 format for later use in prediction.

New images can be classified using this saved model, either in a terminal or web interface.
