🧠 Project Summary
HematoVision is a deep learning-powered solution that classifies blood cells into four major types:

Eosinophils

Lymphocytes

Monocytes

Neutrophils

Using a pre-trained CNN model (.h5), users can upload a microscopic blood cell image and receive an instant prediction. The project is implemented using:

Python (Flask framework)

TensorFlow/Keras

Bootstrap (for frontend UI)

🎯 Key Features
Web-based interface for image upload and real-time prediction

Modular backend with Flask and TensorFlow integration

Educational and clinical use case applications

Clean UI built with HTML5 and Bootstrap 5

Portable and runs on CPU with no external dependencies

🏥 Real-World Applications
Hospital pathology labs

Rural and mobile healthcare units

Medical colleges and training centers

Telemedicine platforms
